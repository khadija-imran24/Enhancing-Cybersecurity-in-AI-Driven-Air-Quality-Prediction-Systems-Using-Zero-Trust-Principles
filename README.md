# Enhancing-Cybersecurity-in-AI-Driven-Air-Quality-Prediction-Systems-Using-Zero-Trust-Principles
AI-driven air quality forecasting systems are essential to environmental monitoring but are vulnerable to emerging cybersecurity threats such as adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and unauthorized entry. Traditional security models based on built-in trust are unable to protect such systems. This project bridges this gap by extending Zero Trust principles to an AI-driven Air Quality Index (AQI) forecasting system for Pakistan.
The architecture integrates machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) with Zero Trust controls for:
High Accuracy: Models achieved RÂ² > 0.7 at 5-fold cross-validation; hence, AQI predictions can be trusted.
Strong Security: The framework is protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC), as well as SHA-256 hashing for cryptographic integrity checks against threats from adversarial inputs and model tampering.
Resilience in the Real World: Data integrity and model integrity are ensured by schema validation, statistical anomaly detection, and safe model deployment mechanisms.
The test results demonstrated 100% detection of adversarial inputs, >95% uptime consistency, and poison data avoidance, therefore, validating that the framework is efficient. This work provides a scalable template for securing AI systems in the mission-critical realm, without comprising on performance, thus bringing the two worlds of cybersecurity and AI innovation closer.
